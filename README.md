# UTMN_WIFI_connect_script
Simple bash script and WPA profile template for easy connection to UTMN wifi network

For all homies who uses linux.

Meant for use with NetworkManager and wpa_supplicant

If you study in UTMN in 2025 - ... it might be resolved by sysadmins enabling newer TLS support for phase 1 PEAP. Until then it is only way to connect UTMN wifi network using some of linux distros.

Working state checked on:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Archlinux (and Arch-based disrtos)
